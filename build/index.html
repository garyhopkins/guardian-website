                property damage and estimating the true value of losses. We will
                thoroughly inspect your property, identify all damages, and
                document them properly. This includes taking photographs,

                items affected.

              <p>
                My name is Forrest Brothen, and I have overcome a challenging
                experience that has motivated me to make a positive impact in
                the lives of others. In December of 2007, my family's home
                unfortunately burned to the ground. Although I faced several
                difficulties with my insurance claim, this setback inspired me
                to gain knowledge and understanding of the public insurance
                adjusting process.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since then, I have transformed this personal adversity into an
                opportunity to assist others in their time of need. With the
                opening of Guardian Claims Consultants, I have made a commitment
                to ensure that no one else faces a similar situation without the
                support they deserve. I am here to provide valuable guidance and
                help protect your family and home.

          <h4>
            When disaster strikes, negotiating your property loss can be
            overwhelming. Your insurance company may seem friendly, but their
            goal is to pay you as little as they can. Insurance companies know
            all the tricks to keep your payout low. Thereâ€™s a good chance you
            stand to lose big without serious help in your corner. Before you
            sign a settlement, ask a professional for help. Guardian Claim
            Consultants adjusters are licensed professionals who work
            exclusively for YOU, the policyholder, to get you more money for
            your damages.

          <div class="faq-answer">
            Following a disaster, the insurance company may propose a prompt
            settlement, but caution is advised. This amount may not adequately
            reimburse you and could fall significantly short of what you

            What does a public insurance adjuster do?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            A public insurance adjuster works solely for you, not the insurance
            company, and serves as your expert in managing loss adjustments.
            Their role involves aiding you in the preparation, submission, and
            adjustment of insurance claims following a covered loss. They
            perform inventories, facilitate appraisals, and handle the aspects
            of the policy that directly affect you. This often entails various
            steps that you may have limited knowledge of, yet can substantially
            impact the final settlement amount.

          <div class="faq-question">
            Why should I hire a public insurance adjuster?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            While insurance companies prioritize their profits, it's important
            to note that the adjusters they employ often face heavy workloads
            and insufficient compensation. Due to time constraints, many company
            adjusters may not thoroughly assess everything you are rightfully
            entitled to. Furthermore, adjusters directly employed by insurance
            companies may have incentives tied to their earnings, raises,
            potential promotions, and pressure from supervisors to minimize
            expenses whenever possible. In contrast, a public insurance adjuster
            will diligently collaborate with you to meticulously prepare and
            present your claim to the insurance company, always prioritizing
            your best interests over those of the insurance company.

        <div class="faq-card">
          <div class="faq-question">
            Doesn't my insurance company provide me with an experienced and
            licensed adjuster?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            While one might assume otherwise, it's essential not to rely solely
            on this assumption. Especially in today's climate, where numerous
            storms have increased the demand for adjusters, there's a
            possibility that your assigned adjuster may have limited prior
            experience in handling insurance claims. Surprisingly, insurance
            company adjusters are not required to undergo comprehensive
            education or licensing procedures. They can transition from
            unrelated professions, like shoe salesmen, to insurance adjusters in
            a short span of time. The current high demand for adjusters means
            that sometimes any available person is assigned to the role. To
            ensure your peace of mind, consider inquiring about your adjuster's
            experience, training, and licensing. (Note: No offense intended
            towards shoe salesmen; my preference lies in having a qualified
            professional handle my claim!)

          <div class="faq-question">
            What is a public adjusters fee for their services?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            The public insurance adjuster's fee is a percentage of the insurance
            company's settlement with you. By seeking to maximize your
            settlement, your public insurance adjuster's service can save you
            the cost of their fees.
